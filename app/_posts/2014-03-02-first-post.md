# A new beginning again...

I have had many new beginnings, another is just beginning,
each new beginning I start a blog which I don't really do much
with, I won't make any apologies for this. Here I'll post some
coding stuff but I mostly want to cover...

#### My move to San Francisco.

I am moving to San Francisco for love. I am currently applying for my visa, if
all goes well I am due to move in April. I am very fortunate for the Financial
Times to aid in my relocation. In order help me work remotely I will be keeping
regular work journals to help me give more detailed weekly reports.

I figure a journal like this could also be very helpful eith my home projecs so
I shall jot down notes from projects I am working on. The foremost of which will
be this site. A friend of mine has been kind enough to design the site for me.
(I can't design for toffee.) 

I can't guarantee this will be kept amazingly upto date but I will try my best.

### Project Goals:

Implement fruitmachine on server and client using node.

 * Support server rendered pages.
 * Use as a basis for fruitmachine helper development.
 * Work on a web component helper

To get me started I am using yeoman's Gulp webapp generator to give me a whole bunch of scaffolding. (Lazy Ada)

    install -g generator-gulp-webapp
    yo
    npm install fruitmachine

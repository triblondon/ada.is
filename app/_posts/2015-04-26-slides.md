title:  "How I rolled my own presentation solution in a couple of hours with es6"

For my [talk at the Extensible Web Summit](http://localhost:9000/blog/2015/04/26/slides/) I needed a custom solution because I needed to run custom code in the slides without the time to learn to use a tool like [slid.es](http://slid.es).

End result: https://www.1am.club/~ada/ews-slides/

### Setup

I started off with a custom [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) template I'd made based upon the (gulp webapp generator)[https://github.com/yeoman/generator-gulp-webapp] it adds es6 transpiling with traceur and browserify (through traceurify) this boiler plate allows me to very quickly prototype webapps with es6 and scss.

I did use JQuery ðŸ˜ž because I was very short on time and it allowed me to cut corners in writing the code.

Currently only chrome and ff are supported i'll add iPad support next time I need to give a talk.

### How it works

The slide displaying is handled purely through css transforms which allows me to animate them in/out at 60fps easily.  
This has issues on osx compositing chnages don't seem to update on fullscreen on secondary monitors. ðŸ˜ž

The slideshow code is handled over 3 very small (<100loc) modules.

 * [`main.js`](https://github.com/AdaRoseEdwards/ews-slides/blob/master/app/scripts/main.js)
 * [`slides.js`](https://github.com/AdaRoseEdwards/ews-slides/blob/master/app/scripts/lib/slides.js)
 * [`webrtc.js`](https://github.com/AdaRoseEdwards/ews-slides/blob/master/app/scripts/lib/webrtc.js)

#### main.js

`main.js` is the browserify entry point it handles DOM manipulation and sets up listeners for keypress/clicks. I initially used [hammerjs](http://hammerjs.github.io/) to allow for touch swiping on mobile devices but this prevented me from scrolling the notes so I disabled it for this build.

#### slides.js

`slides.js` is quite lovely (if I do say so myself) each slide has 3 functions `setup: function ()`, `teardown: function ()` and `action: function *()` if you have a keen eye you'll notice the `*` which denotes the action function as a generator.

`setup` is run when the slide is first initiated (see `goToSlide()` in `main.js`) the action is the generator is then setup and run once to reach the first `yield` statement. when the user interacts with the page `.next()` is run and if it is done then it sets up the next slide. (See `triggerEvent()` in `main.js`).

This allows me to easily step through a large block of code so we can see the status of the DOM at each `yield` allowing us to breakdown the animation code into steps.

The downside of this is that to use the generators the Traceur transpiler needs to add a runtime component which is about 100k but for an entirely front loaded media heavy page such as a slideshow this is not a big issue.

#### webrtc.js

`webrtc.js` is the controller for recieving/sending commands to the client. To save time here we use the great [`PeerJS`](http://peerjs.com/)

If a client connects with a `location.hash` of `#controller` then they will become the master slideshow. They will be shown the slideshow notes regardless of the screen size.

If that hash is not present or the master role is taken then they will fallback to being the client and will connect to the master slideshow via webrtc.

When the master slideshow performs any action this gets passed to all of the client slideshows and they will respond. This allows me to control every slideshow whilst I am giving my presentation from my smartphone whilst also getting having my notes to hand. It also allows me to demo my talk remotely without screen casting.

### Issues

https + cloudflare + peerjs provided some unexpected issues. I am hosting the presentation https://1am.club which is https only this means that I need to run peer.js in secure mode so will need to host my own. Fortunately I already run peerjs on 1am club but it had been untested since I put cloudflare infront of the server to speed up connections and provide caching. Unfortunately peerjs relies on websockets to connect to the signalling server and cloudflare as of writing cannot handle websockets for non business customers. I tweaked my cloudflare setup to run `//www.1am.club` through cloudflare and `//1am.club` to go straight through to the aws server. I then set peerjs to connect straight to `1am.club`. 

On the night itself the presentation computer lost connection because it was put to sleep since it was a lightning talk and I only had limited time instead of faffing with refreshing the target computer over flaky wifi and hoping it would connect I just gave the talk from memory controlling the presentation from the presentation computer. Which was not as flashy.

Fullscreen + mac + secondary monitor, it seems the compositing effects would not show up on the sencond moitor when fullscreen which is odd. I do not have a mac so cannot debug this so any insight would be welcome.

It doesn't work on iOS which needs to be addressed.


### Styling

For the general styling the app is built of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Bootstrap-Material-Design](https://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/) to get the basic styling. This is *extremely* wasteful since 90% of the provided styles and scripts will not be used at all.

The material design elements were very useful for quickly assembling realistic looking demo webapps for the slides I made 4 demoes in 4 hours on the flight from the UK.

The presentation has two main modes, on small screen or if the master controller then then the notes are displayed and the slideshow is hidden. This allows me to have notes on my phone if I need them and the slideshow on presentation medium which is quite neat.

The slide transition animation for a little bit of flair at no extra cost I use a custom transition function I designed using the [Ceaser editor](http://matthewlein.com/ceaser/) it has a small anticipation and elasticity.

The slide transformations are quite nice too and pretty neat:

{% highlight scss %}
.slide {

	// By default all slides are off to the left
	transition: transform 1.5s cubic-bezier(0.030, 0.200, 0.360, 1.210);
	transform: translateX(-100%) translateZ(-50px) rotateY(-10deg);

	// The active slide has no transform
	&.active {
		transform: translateX(0);
	}

	// All of the slides after the active one are off to the right
	&.active~.slide {
		transform: translateX(100%) translateZ(-50px) rotateY(10deg);
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

the small translate Z and rotateY give a really nice 'album cover switcher' effect. Even if many slides get skipped at once it still looks really nice.

### Todo

* Address issues listed above
* Clean up and seperate sass so that the talk specific styles go in their own file.
* namespace the master controller peerjs id to the talk name
* remove dependence on bootstrap and jquery

## Conclusion

For a small 'Ada-Special' solution to doing a presentation it worked really well the tech is elegant and it doesn't need much cleaning up to be ready for a 1.0 release.

Definetly a project to keep working on.
